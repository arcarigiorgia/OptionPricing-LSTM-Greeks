# LSTM-BlackScholes-OptionPricing

This project implements a hybrid model to predict European call option prices and their Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) using the Black-Scholes formula and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Historical market data is fetched from Yahoo Finance to train and evaluate the model.

## Features
- **Black-Scholes Pricing**: Calculate European call option prices and Greeks.
- **LSTM-based Forecasting**: Predict future option prices and Greeks using LSTM.
- **Market Data Integration**: Download and preprocess SPY data, including daily returns and volatility.
- **Error Analysis**: Compare real vs predicted Greeks with visualizations.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LSTM-BlackScholes-OptionPricing.git
   cd LSTM-BlackScholes-OptionPricing
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script to download market data, train the model, and generate predictions:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Output graphs and figures will be saved in the `figures/` directory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- yfinance
- scipy

## Results

- **Model Evaluation**: Metrics such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and R² are used to assess model performance.
- **Visualizations**: Graphs comparing real vs predicted option prices and Greeks are generated.
