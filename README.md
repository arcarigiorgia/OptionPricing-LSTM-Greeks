# OptionPricing-LSTM-Greeks
This project predicts European call option prices and Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega) using a hybrid model combining the Black-Scholes formula and LSTM networks. It downloads historical SPY data, calculates volatility, and trains an LSTM to forecast option pricing and Greeks with visual error analysis.
